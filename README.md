Then drop the mod dll in the Mods folder.

TIP: pass --melonloader.console to vrchat as a launch parameter to show the game console, very useful when using mods.


Press F4 to dump a list of active players working with the mod, useful for debugging.

Press F1 to enable/disable the mod. You can also use the button in the quick menu if you're in VR or don't want to use the keyboard.
